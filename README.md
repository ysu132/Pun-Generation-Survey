# A Survey of Pun Generation: Datasets, Evaluations and Methodologies

This is reading list for pun generation survey.

## Pun Categories
#### Homophonic Puns
Homophonic puns rely on the dual meanings of homophones, which are words that sound alike but have different meanings. <br/>
Eg. Dentists don't like a hard day at the <ins>orifice</ins> (office).
#### Heterographic Puns
Heterographic puns emphasize on differences in spelling with the same pronunciation to achieve their rhetorical effect, which are also classified as homophonic puns in some studies. <br/>
Eg. Life is a puzzle, look here for the missing <ins>peace</ins> (piece). 
#### Homographic Puns
Homographic puns exploit words spelled the same homographs but possess different meanings. <br/>
Eg. Always trust a glue salesman. They tend to <ins>stick</ins> to their word. 
#### Visual Puns
Visual puns are a form of artistic expression that utilize images or visual elements to create double meanings. <br/>
Eg. An visual example from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_pun).  <br/>
